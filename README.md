ðŸ“¬ Firebase Message Form with Generative AI Guidance

This project is a simple web application that allows users to send a message (name, email, and text) and stores it in Firebase Firestore.
What makes this project unique is that it was entirely built using prompts and guidance from a generative AI (ChatGPT) â€” from setting up Firebase to writing the HTML, JavaScript, and debugging errors. It showcases how developers can leverage AI to accelerate learning, rapid prototyping, and problem-solving.

ðŸ’¡ Purpose
To demonstrate the real-world utility of generative AI in building a complete front-end + database integration project.
To explore how AI can act as a collaborative coding partner, helping with everything from form design to Firebase configuration and debugging.

ðŸ”§ Features
Responsive message submission form (HTML)
Firestore integration using Firebase Web SDK (JavaScript modules)
Stores name, email, message, and timestamp
Fully functional on Replit (HTML/CSS/JS static project)

ðŸš€ How to Run
Clone this project on Replit or your local environment.
Set up a Firebase project and Firestore database.
Replace the Firebase config in script.js with your own credentials.
Run the HTML file. Messages will be saved directly to your Firestore collection.

ðŸ¤– Built Entirely with Prompts
Every line of code, every fix, and even this README were created through AI-generated responses â€” proving that with the right prompts, you can build real applications faster than ever before.
